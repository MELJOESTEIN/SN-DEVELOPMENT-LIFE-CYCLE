# MongoDB Database Security Threat Report

## Executive Summary
This report identifies potential security vulnerabilities in the MongoDB database implementation for the We.Code SDLC project. The analysis focuses on the database schema, authentication mechanisms, data validation, and access controls. The identified vulnerabilities could potentially lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents if not addressed.

## Identified Threats and Vulnerabilities

### 1. Exposed Database Credentials
**Severity: Critical**

- **Issue**: Database connection string with plaintext credentials is stored in the `.env` file and exposed in logs.
- **Details**: The connection string `mongodb+srv://thierry:thierry%40123@we-code-sdlc.kteph.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=We-Code-SDLC` contains hardcoded username and password.
- **Risk**: If the codebase is compromised or accidentally shared, attackers gain direct database access.
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Use environment variables for all sensitive credentials
  - Never log connection strings with credentials
  - Implement credential rotation policies
  - Consider using MongoDB Atlas IAM authentication for more secure access

### 2. Insufficient Input Validation
**Severity: High**

- **Issue**: Lack of comprehensive input validation before database operations.
- **Details**: 
  - User input from request bodies is directly used in database queries without proper sanitization
  - No schema validation for array fields (`articles` and `cryptos` arrays)
  - No validation for email format in user registration
- **Risk**: Potential for NoSQL injection attacks, which could allow attackers to:
  - Bypass authentication
  - Access unauthorized data
  - Execute arbitrary code
- **Recommendation**:
  - Implement comprehensive input validation for all user inputs
  - Use Mongoose schema validation features more extensively
  - Sanitize all inputs before using in database operations
  - Consider using a validation library like Joi or express-validator

### 3. Inadequate Access Controls
**Severity: High**

- **Issue**: Role-based access control implementation has weaknesses.
- **Details**:
  - Role verification relies on simple string comparison (`req.data.role !== "admin"`)
  - No fine-grained permission system beyond basic "admin" and "user" roles
  - Potential for privilege escalation in user update functionality
- **Risk**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data or operations if role verification is bypassed.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Implement more robust role-based access control
  - Add fine-grained permissions beyond basic roles
  - Use middleware for consistent access control enforcement
  - Consider implementing attribute-based access control for more complex scenarios

### 4. Weak Password Policies
**Severity: Medium**

- **Issue**: Minimal password requirements and handling.
- **Details**:
  - Password policy only requires 8 characters minimum
  - No complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
  - No password expiration or history policies
- **Risk**: Weak passwords are susceptible to brute force and dictionary attacks.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Implement stronger password policies
  - Add password complexity requirements
  - Consider implementing password expiration and history
  - Add rate limiting for authentication attempts

### 5. Insecure JWT Implementation
**Severity: Medium**

- **Issue**: JWT implementation has security weaknesses.
- **Details**:
  - No token expiration (JWT tokens are valid indefinitely)
  - No refresh token mechanism
  - JWT secret key is stored in plaintext in .env file
- **Risk**: Stolen tokens remain valid indefinitely, increasing the impact of token theft.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Add token expiration (short-lived tokens)
  - Implement refresh token mechanism
  - Store JWT secret securely
  - Consider using asymmetric key signing (RS256 instead of HS256)

### 6. Unprotected Sensitive Data
**Severity: Medium**

- **Issue**: Sensitive user data lacks additional protection.
- **Details**:
  - User passwords are hashed with bcrypt (good practice)
  - However, other potentially sensitive user information has no additional encryption
  - No field-level encryption for sensitive data
- **Risk**: If database is compromised, all non-password user data is exposed in plaintext.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Implement field-level encryption for sensitive data
  - Consider using MongoDB's Client-Side Field Level Encryption
  - Apply the principle of least privilege to database users

### 7. Lack of Database Activity Monitoring
**Severity: Medium**

- **Issue**: No monitoring or logging of database access and operations.
- **Details**:
  - No audit trail of database operations
  - No monitoring for suspicious activities
  - No alerting system for potential security incidents
- **Risk**: Security incidents may go undetected for extended periods.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Enable MongoDB auditing
  - Implement logging of all sensitive database operations
  - Set up alerts for suspicious activities
  - Consider using MongoDB Atlas Advanced Security features

### 8. Unvalidated Schema Updates
**Severity: Low**

- **Issue**: Schema updates lack validation.
- **Details**:
  - Updates to user documents don't validate the entire document structure
  - Array fields (`articles` and `cryptos`) have no schema validation
- **Risk**: Database integrity could be compromised over time.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Implement comprehensive validation for all document updates
  - Define schemas for array elements
  - Use Mongoose middleware to validate documents before saving

### 9. Missing Database Connection Error Handling
**Severity: Low**

- **Issue**: Insufficient error handling for database connection failures.
- **Details**:
  - Basic error logging but no robust recovery mechanisms
  - No connection pooling configuration
- **Risk**: Application may behave unpredictably during database connectivity issues.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Implement robust error handling for database connections
  - Configure connection pooling appropriately
  - Add reconnection strategies with exponential backoff

## Remediation Priorities

### Immediate Actions (1-2 weeks)
1. Secure database credentials and connection strings
2. Implement comprehensive input validation
3. Enhance access control mechanisms
4. Add JWT token expiration and refresh mechanism

### Short-term Actions (1-3 months)
1. Strengthen password policies
2. Implement field-level encryption for sensitive data
3. Set up database activity monitoring and alerting
4. Improve error handling and connection management

### Long-term Actions (3-6 months)
1. Conduct a comprehensive security review
2. Implement advanced security features
3. Consider migrating to more secure authentication methods
4. Develop a security training program for developers

## Conclusion
The MongoDB implementation in the We.Code SDLC project has several security vulnerabilities that could potentially lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents. By addressing these vulnerabilities according to the recommended priorities, the security posture of the application can be significantly improved.
